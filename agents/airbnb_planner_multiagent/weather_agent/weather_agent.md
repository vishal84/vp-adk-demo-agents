# Weather Agent Code Explanation

## Overview
The Weather Agent provides weather information and forecasts using the A2A protocol and Google ADK. It leverages MCP tools to interact with external weather APIs and geocoding services, and streams results to users.

## Main Components
- **`__main__.py`**: Entry point for the weather agent server. Initializes the ADK agent, sets up the A2AStarletteApplication, and starts the Uvicorn server.
- **`weather_agent.py`**: Defines the ADK agent using LiteLlm and MCPToolset. Specifies the agent's instruction and toolset for weather queries.
- **`weather_executor.py`**: Implements `WeatherExecutor`, which runs the ADK agent, manages sessions, and handles streaming responses and task updates.
- **`weather_mcp.py`**: Implements MCP tools for weather alerts, forecasts by coordinates, and forecasts by city/state. Handles API requests, geocoding, and response formatting.
- **`README.md`**: Provides setup and usage instructions for the weather agent.

## Flow
1. The server starts and initializes the ADK agent with weather tools.
2. Incoming requests are processed by `WeatherExecutor`, which streams results from the agent.
3. MCP tools interact with weather APIs and geocoding services to fulfill user queries.
4. Responses are formatted and streamed back to the user, with error handling and input requests managed as needed.

## Key Patterns
- Tool-based agent orchestration
- Streaming response handling
- Geocoding and API integration
- Secure input validation

## Security Notes
All external data and agent input should be validated and sanitized to prevent vulnerabilities and ensure reliable operation.
