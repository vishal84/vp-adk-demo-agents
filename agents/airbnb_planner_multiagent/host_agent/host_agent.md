# Host Agent Code Explanation

## Overview
The Host Agent acts as the central router and orchestrator, delegating user requests to specialized remote agents (Airbnb and Weather) using the A2A protocol and Google ADK. It provides a Gradio-based frontend and manages agent connections, task routing, and session state.

## Main Components
- **`__main__.py`**: Launches the Gradio interface and initializes the routing agent runner. Handles user input and displays responses, including tool calls and results.
- **`remote_agent_connection.py`**: Manages connections to remote agents using HTTPX and the A2A client. Handles message sending, task polling, and error management.
- **`routing_agent.py`**: Implements the `RoutingAgent` class, which asynchronously discovers remote agents, delegates tasks, and coordinates responses. Defines the root instruction and toolset for routing.
- **`README.md`**: Provides setup and usage instructions for the host agent frontend.

## Flow
1. The Gradio app receives user input and passes it to the routing agent.
2. The routing agent determines which remote agent (Airbnb or Weather) should handle the request.
3. Requests are sent to the appropriate agent via `RemoteAgentConnections`, and responses are streamed back to the user.
4. Session state and active agent tracking ensure context continuity and correct routing.

## Key Patterns
- Asynchronous agent discovery and initialization
- Task delegation and routing
- Session and context management
- Error handling and user input relay

## Security Notes
All remote agent data is untrusted. Input validation and secure handling of agent cards, messages, and artifacts are required to prevent prompt injection and other vulnerabilities.
